# SMDDP-Examples
Repository for Forked Deep Learning Examples Used in SageMaker Data Distributed Training

The `master` branch contains herring-ready training examples to be deployed on P-Clusters/SageMaker. The `alternative` branch contains the same training examples but with different distributed training options e.g. PT-DDP (NCCL) for Pytorch or Horovod for TensorFlow.
